# My Fan Page - HTML/CSS Lab Project

## Overview
This is a static HTML/CSS educational project designed as a lab assignment for students to learn HTML elements and basic web page structure. Students create a fan page for their favorite TV character, celebrity, historical figure, or role model.

## Project Type
- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS website
- **Backend**: None
- **Language**: HTML, CSS
- **Server**: Python HTTP server for development

## Project Structure
```
.
├── index.html          # Main HTML template (starter file for students)
├── style.css           # CSS styling with basic div and image styles
├── U1LAB1.md          # Lab instructions and requirements
└── replit.md          # This file - project documentation
```

## Current State
- The project is a **starter template** for students to complete
- The index.html contains a basic skeleton with a comment: "Your code here!"
- Students need to add content based on the lab requirements

## Lab Requirements
Students must create a fan page with:
1. Header/Intro section with name, quote, and picture
2. About Me section describing what the person is known for
3. Achievements section with at least 3 nested divs
4. Other section with links to related websites

Required HTML elements:
- HTML skeleton (html, head, body)
- At least 2 header elements (h1, h3, etc)
- At least 1 paragraph element
- At least 1 image element
- At least 1 anchor element
- All elements nested in divs with appropriate IDs

## Development Setup
- **Workflow**: Python HTTP server on port 5000
- **Command**: `python -m http.server 5000`
- **Access**: The webview shows the static site

## Deployment
- **Type**: Autoscale (static website)
- **Command**: `python -m http.server`
- Configured for production deployment via Replit's publish feature

## Recent Changes (October 7, 2025)
- Initial Replit environment setup
- Configured Python 3.11 for HTTP server
- Set up development workflow on port 5000
- Configured deployment settings for static site hosting
- Created project documentation

## Notes
- This is an educational starter project - the HTML file intentionally has minimal content
- The CSS file includes pre-made styles for divs, images, and a header ID
- Students will complete this project by adding their own content
